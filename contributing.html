      <h2>Reporting issues</h2>
      <p>Please read the following guidelines before opening any 
      <a href="https://github.com/StarksCode/Pythagorean-Theorem-Solver/issues">issue</a>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Search for existing issues.</strong> Someone else might have already reported the issue you are having and a fix
        has been made or is being worked on.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>Be as clear as possible when reporting an issue.</strong> It is hard to fix an issue if we don't know what the
        issue is being described, maybe include a demo of the issue.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>Don't constantly ask if the issue you opened has been fixed.</strong> It only slows the fixing process down if
        you're constantly asking if the problem has been fixed yet. We'll let you know when it has been fixed.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Pull requests</h2>
      <p>Pull requests are always welcome. Before adding new features, it's probably a good idea to open an issue first and discuss
      it.</p>
      <p>Pull request guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the coding style used in the Pythagorean Theorem Solver.</li>
        <li>Keep your patches small and simple.</li>
        <li>Use a topic branch and open the pull request against the 
        <code>master</code> branch.</li>
      </ul>
