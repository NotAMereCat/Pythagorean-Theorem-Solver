      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>The Pythagorean Theorem was one of the earliest theorems known to ancient civilizations.
      <br />This famous theorem is named for the Greek mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras.
      <br />I've created a Java application that solves the length for any side given that the user has the other two.</p>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>This project began as a simple idea shortly after I had learned about the Pythagorean Theorem in my math class.
      <br />Everyday I would get more and more ideas of how to make it better, until it turned into what it is now.
      <br />I am hoping it will be able to help pay for my Study Abroad trip to Spain.</p>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>Download and installation are simple.
      <br />Go 
      <a href="http://adf.ly/pPBxg">here</a> to download the .jar file, wait for the five seconds to go by then click the "Skip Ad"
      button in the top right corner.
      <br />To run it you must have Java Runtime Environment installed.
      <br />Open the file and enjoy!</p>
