<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem was one of the earliest theorems known to ancient civilizations.<br>
This famous theorem is named for the Greek mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras.<br>
I've created a Java application that solves the length for any side given that the user has the other two.</p>

<h1>Code Example</h1>
<p>The program is based on a simple equation:<br>
double aValue = Double.parseDouble(textField.getText());<br>
double bValue = Double.parseDouble(textField_1.getText());<br>
double cValue = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(aValue, 2) + Math.pow(bValue, 2));<br>
NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getNumberInstance();<br>
textField_2.setText(nf.format(cValue));</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>This project began as a simple idea shortly after I had learned about the Pythagorean Theorem in my math class.<br>
Everyday I would get more and more ideas of how to make it better, until it turned into what it is now.<br>
I am hoping it will be able to help pay for my Study Abroad trip to Spain.</p>
