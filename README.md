<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem was one of the earliest theorems known to ancient civilizations.<br>
This famous theorem is named for the Greek mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras.<br>
I've created a Java application that solves the length for any side given that the user has the other two.</p>

<h1>Code Example</h1>
<p>The program is based on a simple equation:<br>
<code>double legA = Double.parseDouble(textField.getText());<br>
double legB = Double.parseDouble(textField_1.getText());<br>
double hypoC = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(legA, 2) + Math.pow(legB, 2));<br>
NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getNumberInstance();<br>
textField_2.setText(nf.format(hypoC));</p></code>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>This project began as a simple idea shortly after I had learned about the Pythagorean Theorem in my math class.<br>
Everyday I would get more and more ideas of how to make it better, until it turned into what it is now.<br></p>
