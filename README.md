<h2 style="text-align: right;">Synopsis</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">The Pythagorean Theorem was one of the earliest theorems known to ancient civilizations.
This famous theorem is named for the Greek mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras.
I've created a Java application that solves the length for any side given that the user has the other two.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
This project began shortly after I had learned about the Pythagorean Theorem in my math class. Everyday I would get more and more ideas of how to make it better, until it turned into what it is now. I have learned so much about Java by working on this project and I'm super excited to see what other things can be added to it.

<h2 style="text-align: right;">Code Example</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">The source code can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/astarks173362/Pythagorean-Theorem-Solver">project page at GitHub</a>.
The program is based on a simple equation:
<code>double legA = Double.parseDouble(textField.getText());
double legB = Double.parseDouble(textField_1.getText());
double hypoC = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(legA, 2) + Math.pow(legB, 2));
NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getNumberInstance();
textField_2.setText(nf.format(hypoC));</code></p>

<h3>Reporting issues</h3>
Please read the following guidelines before opening any <a href="https://github.com/astarks173362/Pythagorean-Theorem-Solver/issues">issue</a>:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Search for existing issues.</strong> Someone else might have already reported the issue you are having and a fix has been made or is being worked on.</li>
	<li><strong>Be as clear as possible when reporting an issue.</strong> It is hard to fix an issue if we don't know what the issue is being described, maybe include a demo of the issue</li>
	<li><strong>Don't constantly ask if the issue you opened has been fixed.</strong> It only slows the fixing process down if you're constantly asking if the problem has been fixed yet. We'll let you know when it has been fixed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pull requests</h3>
Pull requests are always welcome. Before adding new features, it's probably a good idea to open an issue first and discuss it.
Pull request guidelines:
<ol>
	<li>Follow the coding style used in the Pythagorean Theorem Solver.</li>
	<li>Keep your patches small and simple.</li>
	<li>Use a topic branch and open the pull request against the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
